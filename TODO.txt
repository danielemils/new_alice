O still very rare case of clipping
O metadata still wrong encoding (on 10hr file atleast)
O time remaining not accurate enough

X? normalize input file volume before adding noise and stuff

X? finish fixing DC offset


X? fix windows app icon
X? check out QSettings for saving config/settings in a standard place (not current working directory) (need company name)
X? dynamic gain (compressor? limiter?) for noise (louder noise when no other audio) !!! compand 0.01,0.5 -35,-20,0,-1 0 -20 0.5 !!!
X? estimated time remaining
X? save files as 60-minute chunks (easier for audio players and 60-min is recommended daily listening time)
O consider saving as mono (dno if good idea in case of music, maybe just have a setting)

settings:
    X audio boost (maybe always active)
    mono/stereo (dno if want)
    X add noise
        - noise type (white, pink, brown) (dno if want)
    X custom tremolo effect frequency (prob only around 40hz)

    my idea: maybe tremolo depth setting (volume doesnt have to go all the way to 0)


!!!!!!!!
sox cannot handle special characters (like icelandic characters)
************************
current solution:
use randomly named tempfile in C:/Temp to skip windows username aswell (might have special chars)
need to copy input file to tempfile (has randomly generated name so no issues with sox)
need to have sox save the output to that temp dir (to bypass windows username again)
move the temp output file to the chosen destination path and rename it to correct filename
